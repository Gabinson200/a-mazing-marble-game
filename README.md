# a-mazing-marble-game
Marble labyrinth game for the seeed studio XIAO Nrf Sense board and round display.

The aim of this project is to reproduce a small handheld marble maze game that many of us played in childhood, with the twist that we
can generate infinite amount of maze configurations for unlimited fun.

# Gameplay
Rotate the board and round screen around to control the ball and guide it along the maze until the exit is reached.
Once the exit is reached a new maze will be generated.
There is also a continually running TF-lite micro hand recognition model running in the background that can detect 3 1.5 second long gestures:
- "bow": Cycles through different "difficulties", chaning the number of rows / columns or rings / spokes of the maze.
- "circle": Cycles through the 3 different maze types.
- "sleep": currently toggles the maze drawing animation but might be changed later to put the device into sleep mode.

## Arduino IDE setup
   - Follow the XIAO Nrf Sense board setup [here](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/XIAO_BLE/#software-setup)
   - Follow the round display setup [here](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/get_start_round_display/#software-preparation)
   - Note: We will be using [this](https://github.com/Seeed-Projects/SeeedStudio_lvgl) ported Lvgl 8.3 library
       
**Final Libraries List**  
   - [`lvgl 8.3`](https://github.com/Seeed-Projects/SeeedStudio_lvgl)
   - [`ArduinoGFX`](https://github.com/moononournation/Arduino_GFX/tree/master)
   - [`lv_xiao_round_screen`](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Seeed_Arduino_RoundDisplay)

## Run
Set the MazeChoice variable to the desired maze type and uppload to board. 
(Note: for the clock maze you will have to initialize the RTC with the setup code beforehand)

## Future Additions
- Optimize code for reduced latency
- Add randomly placed "holes" or "fire walls" that when touched reset the player to the start, adding difficulty.
- Add startscreen / menu so maze types and difficulty can be changed on device (Some kind of IMU controlled UI selection could be interesting, if not use the touchscreen)
  
This project was a way for me to learn / relearn some C++ and more specifically object oriented style of programming after years of data sci Python so sorry if its a little noobish.
